                      <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Coca-Cola jointly with South Africa famous golfer Mr. Gary Player, hold a Charity Golf Tour in Shanghai every year.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The day before the official start of the Tour among Celebrities from all walks of life there would be a charity auction dinner, with auction articles donated by the stars, while all proceeds from the auction are donated to Chinese women and youth development foundation.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The event took place during 2011 ~ 2013 with guests such as: Li Yuchun, Jackie Chan, Jolin Tsai, Eason Chan, Liu Xiang, Yao Ming, JJ Lin Junjie, Lee Hom Wang, Sun Yang, Ding Dong, Jane Zhang, etc.   <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A strict invitation system is adopted for the event. Guards are set at the check-in point, and only the guests who have received the invitation are allowed to enter. On the other hand, however, all the guests invited are big stars and celebrities in industrial and commercial circles, the Sponsor must improve the efficiency of check-in and identity check to the maximum to avoid check-in too much long time and queuing. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Finally, the Sponsor also hopes to provide convenient self-service auction system to the guests in the auction field to facilitate their bidding. <br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;3. The Partner provides professional "Man in Black", with the Cloud-ID system to deal with the guests identity check; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;4  Additional Help Desk service for guests to register on-site;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;5.  Engineer on-site support is provided in the whole process for real-time adjustment of guests information. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;6. RFID ID Card used inside by guests is viewed as receipts of self-help bidding and the identity gist for settlement. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;7. After the event, the check-in name list is exported and compared with the list of people invited, so a statistical report is generated. <br>
* The solution is applied in GPI Charity Dinners in the year of 2011. 2012 and 2013.</p>

                      <h5>Project background :</h5>
                      <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Every year Estee Lauder provides a lady salon's tour season, and in different cities it will invite Estee Lauder members to participate in the event of beautiful skin care salon.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Sponsors need to update the latest information of new members and maintain their brand loyalty (gifts and small samples issued) through these events while providing VIP guests with free skin index test and tracking records.    <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In previous years, all the invitations, tracking, records, etc. are conducted through a traditional form of paper and pencil, it is inefficient and very easy to make mistakes, and it often aroused the dissatisfaction from members, and virtually reduced the brand image.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Therefore, Estee Lauder started to use Cloud-ID system in the Lady Salon Tour in the summer of 2012 up to now. </p>
<br>
<h5>Cloud-ID solutions:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Based on the above requirements of the Sponsor and combined with the background of the event, we finally have implemented the following solutions:</h5>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;1. Make web page for invitation. Marketing staff only needs to send the web site to the members, and the members just log in to the web page to fill in the receipt. The system automatically deals with the registration guests list; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;2. With iPAD ‘pilot-style’ smart Check-in system, the guests who have already filled in the receipts can just check in by the name index, and the guests who have not filled in the receipts only need to check in with iPAD which will be switched to the on-site registration mode, and the guests information for those registered on site is automatically uploaded to the guests database through synchronization. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;3. Customize event theme iPAD app UI. iPAD app integrates the electronic color page of the latest product introduction<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;4. iPAD app also provides the administration mode to record and check the gift distribution;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;5. If the system has identified VIP members, it provides additional skin test data record page, and the recorded result is automatically uploaded to the "Cloud" database;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;6. Generate the summary report after the event, and synchronize the event data to the guests member database so as to complete the automatic updating of members information; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;7. Remote engineers' technical services for the whole process of the event.<br>
 * The solution has been applied in "Lady Salon City Tour" in the year of 2012 and 2013.  </p>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;5. Provide RFID scanning hot spots on site at each stall, and only after guests have scanned their RFID ID Card, they can get the corresponding material and are qualified for lottery. The system will record the scanning times of guests and stop time. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;6. Provide Web dashboard for sponsors’ staff to observe the people flow distribution of the whole hall and based upon that, the flow is guided and limited in real-time.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;7. After the event, based on the guests behavior data collected on site, a summary report is generated and together with our partners, data mining services about the guests preferences is provided.<br>
* The solution has been applied in "digital+" Advertising Promotion in the year of 2012 and 2013. </p>

                      <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As the main sponsor of International Golf Tour, HSBC bank (HSBC) hopes to promote its latest financial products to the audiences who come to watch the game by setting the interactive exhibition area in the game area, while recording the potential customer information and providing the follow-up services for business people.  <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The challenge for the project are: how to attract the audiences into the interactive display area?<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And what kind of way will be used to show product information, and record the customer information?<br>
<br>
<h5>Cloud-ID solutions:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Based on the above requirements of the Sponsor and combined with the background of the event, we finally have implemented the following solutions:</h5>

<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;1. Customize RFID card in the shape of golf, with exquisite wrist strap to fit the background of events. Distribute that RFID card to the audiences as souvenirs when they have entered the interactive display area   <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;2.Play product video on-site through HDTV, and install RFID scanning hot spots below each HDTV. Only after the audience have scanned their RFID card, can it be possible to switch among the different product videos. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;3.Install iPAD terminal on site. Audiences can fill in questionnaire after scanning their RFID card, and they can get additional gifts when they completing the questionnaire.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;4.Check whether the audiences have completed the questionnaire by using RFID scanning hot spots at the gift pick-up place.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;5.Use an AR interactive game to attract more audiences into the interactive display area (AR customization development services provided by Zealion, see http://iPLUS.zealion.com).<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;6. Provide engineer on-site support in the whole process. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;7. Record the behavior information of each audience in the display area (what videos has he watched, and the situations of prizes received, etc.) By using RFID technology, which will be automatically associated to the questionnaire information (including personal information) in the database.Data was imported after the event and send to the business department for follow-up. </p>
